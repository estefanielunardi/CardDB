# CARDS DATABASE

Project where we implement the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern.

## INTRODUCTION

It is part 2 of a project that consists of creating a web where users can post their requests in cards (view 1 shows a list of cards displayed with FIFO). Once the person in charge has answered them these cards can move to another view for archived requests.
